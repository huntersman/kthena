                  OptimizerConfiguration enables multi-target optimization that dynamically allocates
                  replicas across heterogeneous ModelServing deployments based on overall compute requirements.
                  This is ideal for mixed hardware environments (e.g., H100/A100 clusters) where you want to
                  optimize resource utilization by adjusting deployment ratios between different hardware types
                  using mathematical optimization methods (e.g. integer programming).

                      flexibility in resource allocation but may increase overall costs.
