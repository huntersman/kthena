# Certificate Management

This page describes the certificate management options available in Kthena for SSL/TLS certificates.

## Overview

Kthena provides **three mutually exclusive certificate management modes** controlled by a single configuration option:

1. **`auto`** (Default): Self-signed certificates automatically generated by webhook servers
2. **`cert-manager`**: Automated certificate lifecycle management using cert-manager
3. **`manual`**: User-provided certificates with custom CA bundle

**Important**: Only one mode can be active at a time. These modes are mutually exclusive and controlled by the `global.certManagementMode` setting.

The integration covers:
- **Admission Webhooks**: TLS certificates for registry, workload, and networking webhook servers
- **Kthena Router**: TLS certificates for external API access
- **Internal Communication**: Service-to-service encrypted communication

## Centralized Certificate Management Configuration

Kthena uses a single enum-based configuration to control certificate management:

```yaml
global:
  # Certificate management mode: auto, cert-manager, or manual
  certManagementMode: auto  # Default: auto
```

### Available Modes

- **`auto`**: Self-signed certificates automatically generated by webhook servers (default)
- **`cert-manager`**: Automated certificate lifecycle management using cert-manager
- **`manual`**: User-provided certificates with custom CA bundle

## Mode 1: Auto-Generated Certificates (Default)

**Status**: Enabled by default (`certManagementMode: auto`)

The simplest way to get started. When enabled, webhook servers automatically generate self-signed certificates on startup if they don't exist.

### Features

- **Zero Configuration**: No external dependencies or manual certificate generation required
- **Multi-Pod Support**: First pod creates the certificate secret; subsequent pods reuse it
- **Automatic Race Condition Handling**: Safe for multiple replicas starting simultaneously
- **10-Year Validity**: Long-lived certificates that don't require frequent rotation

### Configuration

Auto-generated certificates are **enabled by default**. To use this mode explicitly:

```yaml
global:
  certManagementMode: auto  # Default value, can be omitted
```

### How It Works

1. On startup, the webhook server checks if the certificate secret exists
2. If the secret exists, it uses the existing certificates
3. If the secret doesn't exist, it generates:
   - A self-signed CA certificate
   - A server certificate signed by the CA
   - A private key
4. The certificates are stored in a Kubernetes secret with a fixed name
5. If multiple pods start simultaneously, the first one creates the secret; others detect the existing secret and use it

### RBAC Requirements

The service account needs permissions to create and read secrets:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["secrets"]
    verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch"]
```

## Mode 2: CertManager Integration (For Production)

Kthena supports integration with [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) for production-grade certificate management. cert-manager handles certificate lifecycle management including issuance, renewal, and rotation.

**To use this mode**: Set `certManagementMode: cert-manager`

### Prerequisites

Before enabling cert-manager integration, ensure that:

1. **cert-manager is installed** in your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the [official installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
2. **Sufficient RBAC permissions** are available for cert-manager to create and manage certificates in your namespace.

### Configuration

cert-manager integration is controlled through the `global.certManagementMode` setting:

```yaml
global:
  certManagementMode: cert-manager
```

When enabled, Kthena will automatically create:
- Self-signed `Issuer` resources for each component
- `Certificate` resources with appropriate DNS names
- TLS secrets for storing certificates and private keys

### Component-Specific Configuration

#### Kthena Router TLS

For external API access, configure the kthena router TLS settings:

```yaml
networking:
  kthenaRouter:
    enabled: true
    tls:
      enabled: true
      # The DNS name for your external domain
      dnsName: "your-domain.com"
      # Secret name to store the TLS certificate
      secretName: "kthena-router-tls"
```

#### Webhook Certificates

Webhook certificates are automatically configured when cert-manager is enabled. Each subchart (registry, workload, networking) creates its own webhook certificates with internal DNS names:

- `<subchart-name>-webhook.<namespace>.svc`
- `<subchart-name>-webhook.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local`

## Mode 3: Manual Certificate Management

If you prefer to manage certificates manually (e.g., using your organization's PKI), use the `manual` mode and provide your own CA bundle.

**To use this mode**: Set `certManagementMode: manual` and provide the CA bundle.

```yaml
global:
  certManagementMode: manual
  webhook:
    # Base64-encoded CA bundle for webhook certificates
    caBundle: "LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."
```

To generate a CA bundle:
```bash
cat /path/to/your/ca.crt | base64 | tr -d '\n'
```

> **Note**: When using manual mode, you are responsible for providing valid certificates and ensuring they are properly configured for all Kthena components.

## Certificate Resources

When cert-manager integration is enabled, the following resources are created:

### Issuers
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-issuer` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<subchart-name>-router-issuer` (for kthena router)

### Certificates
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-cert` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<subchart-name>-router-cert` (for kthena router)

### Secrets
- `<subchart-name>-webhook-certs` (per subchart: registry, workload, networking)
- `<secretName>` (configurable for kthena router)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### cert-manager Not Found
```
Error: failed to create certificate: cert-manager.io/v1, Kind=Certificate not found
```
**Solution**: Install cert-manager in your cluster before enabling the integration.

#### Certificate Not Ready
```
Certificate is not ready: certificate request has not been approved
```
**Solution**: Check cert-manager logs and ensure the issuer is properly configured:
```bash
kubectl describe certificate <certificate-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager
```

#### Webhook Connection Refused
```
Error: connection refused when calling webhook
```
**Solution**: Verify webhook certificates are properly mounted and the service is accessible:
```bash
kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
kubectl describe secret <webhook-secret-name> -n <namespace>
```

#### DNS Resolution Issues
```
Error: certificate validation failed for DNS name
```
**Solution**: Ensure DNS names in your configuration are resolvable and match your actual service endpoints.

### Debugging Commands

Check certificate status:
```bash
kubectl get certificates -n <namespace>
kubectl describe certificate <certificate-name> -n <namespace>
```

Verify issuer status:
```bash
kubectl get issuers -n <namespace>
kubectl describe issuer <issuer-name> -n <namespace>
```

Check cert-manager logs:
```bash
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager
kubectl logs -n cert-manager deployment/cert-manager-webhook
```

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:
1. Check the [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)
2. Review Kthena logs for certificate-related errors
3. Consult the [cert-manager troubleshooting guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/troubleshooting/)

## Comparison of Certificate Options

| Feature | Auto-Generated | cert-manager | Manual |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| Setup Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| External Dependencies | None | cert-manager required | Certificate generation tools |
| Certificate Rotation | Manual (10-year validity) | Automatic | Manual |
| Production Ready | Development/Testing | Yes | Yes |
| Multi-Pod Support | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Custom CA Support | No (self-signed) | Yes | Yes |
| Certificate Monitoring | Basic | Advanced | Manual |

## Choosing the Right Option

- **Development/Testing**: Use auto-generated certificates for simplicity
- **Production with cert-manager**: Use cert-manager integration for automated lifecycle management
- **Production without cert-manager**: Use manual certificate provisioning with your organization's PKI
- **Air-gapped environments**: Use manual certificate provisioning or auto-generated certificates
